<h2>AboutUs</h2>
  <div><p>A platform cooperative, or platform co-op, is a cooperatively owned, democratically governed business that establishes a computing platform, and uses a website, mobile app or a protocol to facilitate the sale of goods and services. Platform cooperatives are an alternative to venture capital-funded platforms insofar as they are owned and governed by those who depend on them mostâ€”workers, users, and other relevant stakeholders. Startup investing is the action of making an investment in an early-stage company (the startup company). Beyond founders' own contributions, some startups raise additional
investment at some or several stages of their growth. Not all startups trying to raise investments are successful in their fundraising. The idea of these online investing platforms is to streamline the process and resolve the two main points that were taking place in the
market.</p><p> The first problem was for startups to be able to access capital and to decrease the amount of time that it takes to close a round of financing. The second problem was intendedto increase the amount of deal flow for the investor and to also centralize the process.
